# 5.4 Research & Design Methodology

> Invoke when starting a new project from scratch with brief context.
> AI acts as strategic consultant, asking targeted questions to extract project requirements.
> Documentation (PRD, TECH_STACK, TASKS) is produced only at the final stage.

## 0 · Initial Context Gathering

**User provides:** Brief project description or problem statement
**AI responds with:** Strategic questions to understand the core problem

### Discovery Questions Framework
Ask not more than 20 questions adapting based on responses:

**Problem Definition:**
- What specific problem are you trying to solve?
- Who experiences this problem and how often?
- What happens if this problem isn't solved?
- How are people currently handling this problem?

**Stakeholder & Users:**
- Who are the primary users of this solution?
- Who else will be affected by or interact with this system?
- Who has decision-making authority on this project?
- What technical expertise exists on the team?

---

## 1 · Scope & Constraints Discovery

**AI asks targeted questions to define project boundaries:**

**Scope Questions:**
- What are the core features this solution must have?
- What features would be nice to have but aren't essential?
- What is explicitly out of scope for this project?
- How will you know this project is successful?

**Constraint Questions:**
- What's your timeline for this project?
- What budget or resource constraints exist?
- What technical constraints do you have (existing systems, platforms, etc.)?
- Are there regulatory, security, or compliance requirements?

---

## 2 · Technical Requirements Deep Dive

**AI explores technical needs through targeted questioning:**

**Architecture Questions:**
- How many users do you expect (now and in 2 years)?
- What's your tolerance for downtime or performance issues?
- Do you need real-time features or is eventual consistency okay?
- What integrations with existing systems are required?

**Technology Preferences:**
- Do you have preferred programming languages or frameworks?
- What deployment environment (cloud, on-premise, hybrid)?
- What's your team's expertise and comfort level?
- Are there organizational standards you must follow?

---

## 3 · Risk & Complexity Assessment

**AI identifies potential challenges through probing questions:**

**Risk Questions:**
- What's the biggest risk to this project's success?
- What assumptions are you making that might be wrong?
- What external dependencies could block progress?
- What happens if key team members become unavailable?

**Complexity Questions:**
- What parts of this project seem most challenging?
- Where do you expect to need external expertise or research?
- What integration points worry you most?
- What performance or scale requirements are you unsure about?

---

## 4 · Validation & Synthesis

**AI synthesizes all gathered information:**

**Validation Questions:**
- Based on our discussion, does this summary capture your vision accurately?
- Are there any critical aspects we haven't covered?
- What would you change or add to this understanding?
- Do the priorities and constraints seem realistic?

**Synthesis Process:**
- AI presents back a structured summary of all gathered information
- User confirms, corrects, or expands on any points
- AI identifies any gaps or inconsistencies that need clarification
- Final validation before moving to documentation phase

---

## 5 · Final Documentation Generation

**Only after complete discovery, AI generates comprehensive documentation:**

### Core Documentation Suite
Create comprehensive documentation in `docs/` folder:

#### PRD.md (Product Requirements Document)
```markdown
# Project Name - PRD

## Problem Statement
[Clear problem definition]

## Goals & Success Metrics
[Measurable outcomes]

## User Personas & Use Cases
[Target users and their needs]

## Functional Requirements
[What the system must do]

## Non-Functional Requirements
[Performance, security, scalability]

## Constraints & Assumptions
[Limitations and dependencies]

## Out of Scope
[What we're explicitly not doing]
```

#### TECH_STACK.md
```markdown
# Technology Stack Decisions

## Architecture Overview
[High-level system design]

## Technology Choices
### Frontend: [Choice] - [Rationale]
### Backend: [Choice] - [Rationale]
### Database: [Choice] - [Rationale]
### Infrastructure: [Choice] - [Rationale]

## Architecture Decision Records
### ADR-001: [Decision Title]
- Status: Accepted/Deprecated
- Context: [Why this decision was needed]
- Decision: [What was decided]
- Consequences: [Trade-offs and implications]
```

#### TASKS.md
```markdown
# Project Tasks

## Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] 1.1.1: Set up development environment
- [ ] 1.1.2: Initialize project structure
- [ ] 1.1.3: Configure CI/CD pipeline

## Phase 2: Core Features
[Detailed task breakdown]

## Phase 3: Integration & Testing
[Testing and integration tasks]

## Phase 4: Deployment & Launch
[Deployment and launch tasks]
```

## 6 · Validation & Iteration

- **Prototype development** — Build minimal viable prototypes to test key assumptions.
- **Stakeholder review cycles** — Regular check-ins with stakeholders for feedback.
- **Technical spike execution** — Investigate high-risk technical areas.
- **Documentation updates** — Keep all docs synchronized with new learnings.
- **Go/no-go decision points** — Define criteria for proceeding to development phase.

---

## 7 · Design Thinking Principles

### Human-Centered Design
- **Empathy mapping** — Understand user needs, pains, and motivations.
- **Journey mapping** — Map user interactions and touchpoints.
- **Accessibility considerations** — Design for diverse user abilities and contexts.

### Iterative Approach
- **Rapid prototyping** — Quick, low-fidelity tests of key concepts.
- **Fail fast principle** — Identify and address issues early when changes are cheap.
- **Feedback loops** — Regular validation with users and stakeholders.

### Systems Thinking
- **Holistic view** — Consider the entire ecosystem, not just the immediate solution.
- **Unintended consequences** — Anticipate how changes might affect other systems.
- **Scalability planning** — Design for future growth and evolution.

## 8 · Quality Gates & Deliverables

### Phase Completion Criteria
- [ ] Problem is clearly defined and validated
- [ ] Requirements are documented and prioritized
- [ ] Technology stack decisions are made and documented
- [ ] Project tasks are broken down and estimated
- [ ] Risks are identified with mitigation plans

## 9 · Transition to Development

- **Handoff preparation** — Ensure all documentation is complete and accessible.
- **Development environment setup** — Prepare tools, repositories, and CI/CD pipelines.
- **Team alignment** — Brief development team on decisions and rationale.
- **First sprint planning** — Select initial tasks and establish development rhythm.
- **Communication channels** — Set up project communication and status reporting.

> **Next Phase:** Move to active development following task management and development standards.
